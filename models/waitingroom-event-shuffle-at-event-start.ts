/**
 * If enabled, users in the prequeue will be shuffled randomly at the `event_start_time`. Requires that `prequeue_start_time` is not null. This is useful for situations when many users will join the event prequeue at the same time and you want to shuffle them to ensure fairness. Naturally, it makes the most sense to enable this feature when the `queueing_method` during the event respects ordering such as **fifo**, or else the shuffling may be unnecessary.
