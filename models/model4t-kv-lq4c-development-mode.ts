 * Cloudflare API
 * Interact with Cloudflare's products and services via the Cloudflare API.  Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to grant access to the API to perform actions.  To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile > API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).  Totally new to Cloudflare?

 * Development Mode temporarily allows you to enter development mode for your websites if you need to make changes to your site. This will bypass Cloudflare's accelerated cache and slow down your site, but is useful if you are making changes to cacheable content (like images, css, or JavaScript) and would like to see those changes right away. Once entered, development mode will last for 3 hours and then automatically toggle off.
