 * Cloudflare API
 * Interact with Cloudflare's products and services via the Cloudflare API.  Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to grant access to the API to perform actions.  To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile > API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).  Totally new to Cloudflare?

/**
 * Rocket Loader is a general-purpose asynchronous JavaScript optimisation that prioritises rendering your content while loading your site's Javascript asynchronously. Turning on Rocket Loader will immediately improve a web page's rendering time sometimes measured as Time to First Paint (TTFP), and also the `window.onload` time (assuming there is JavaScript on the page). This can have a positive impact on your Google search ranking. When turned on, Rocket Loader will automatically defer the loading of all Javascript referenced in your HTML, with no configuration required. Refer to [Understanding Rocket Loader](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200168056) for more information.
