 * Cloudflare API
 * Interact with Cloudflare's products and services via the Cloudflare API.  Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to grant access to the API to perform actions.  To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile > API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).  Totally new to Cloudflare?

/**
 * Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. This is a template html file that will be rendered at the edge. If no custom_page_html is provided, the default waiting room will be used. The template is based on mustache ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There are several variables that are evaluated by the Cloudflare edge: 1. {{`waitTimeKnown`}} Acts like a boolean value that indicates the behavior to take when wait time is not available, for instance when queue_all is **true**.  2. {{`waitTimeFormatted`}} Estimated wait time for the user. For example, five minutes. Alternatively, you can use:  3. {{`waitTime`}} Number of minutes of estimated wait for a user. 4. {{`waitTimeHours`}} Number of hours of estimated wait for a user (`Math.floor(waitTime/60)`).  5. {{`waitTimeHourMinutes`}} Number of minutes above the `waitTimeHours` value (`waitTime%60`).  6. {{`queueIsFull`}} Changes to **true** when no more people can be added to the queue.  To view the full list of variables, look at the `cfWaitingRoom` object described under the `json_response_enabled` property in other Waiting Room API calls.
