 * Interact with Cloudflare's products and services via the Cloudflare API.  Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to grant access to the API to perform actions.  To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile > API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).  Totally new to Cloudflare?

/**
 * The mode that defines how rules within the package are evaluated during the course of a request. When a package uses anomaly detection mode (`anomaly` value), each rule is given a score when triggered. If the total score of all triggered rules exceeds the sensitivity defined in the WAF package, the action configured in the package will be performed. Traditional detection mode (`traditional` value) will decide the action to take when it is triggered by the request. If multiple rules are triggered, the action providing the highest protection will be applied (for example, a 'block' action will win over a 'challenge' action).
