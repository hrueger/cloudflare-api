 * Cloudflare API
 * Interact with Cloudflare's products and services via the Cloudflare API.  Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to grant access to the API to perform actions.  To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile > API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).  Totally new to Cloudflare?

 * An object that allows you to enable or disable WAF rule groups for the current WAF override. Each key of this object must be the ID of a WAF rule group, and each value must be a valid WAF action (usually `default` or `disable`). When creating a new URI-based WAF override, you must provide a `groups` object or a `rules` object.
