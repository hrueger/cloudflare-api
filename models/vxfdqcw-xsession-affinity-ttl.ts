 * Cloudflare API
 * Interact with Cloudflare's products and services via the Cloudflare API.  Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to grant access to the API to perform actions.  To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile > API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).  Totally new to Cloudflare?

 * Time, in seconds, until a client's session expires after being created. Once the expiry time has been reached, subsequent requests may get sent to a different origin server. The accepted ranges per `session_affinity` policy are: - `\"cookie\"` / `\"ip_cookie\"`: The current default of 23 hours will be used unless explicitly set. The accepted range of values is between [1800, 604800].  - `\"header\"`: The current default of 1800 seconds will be used unless explicitly set. The accepted range of values is between [30, 3600]. Note: With session affinity by header, sessions only expire after they haven't been used for the number of seconds specified.
